        <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed â€“ in making your own website, are you
            happy with the tools you used? </h2>
        <p>
            Visual Studio Code is what I used to create my website, without it my website would not exist. Throughout
            the process it was easy to use and any errors I occurred were done due to me missing some sort of
            punctuation like { or ;
        </p>
        <p>
            I kept updating my Trello board throughout the project to make me aware of what tasks I was needing to
            complete and the tasks I had finished. I colour coded the questions by what unit they were a part of and
            left the website tasks not colour coded.
        </p>
        <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>
        <p>
            Visual Studio Code was definitely an appropriate tool as it was easy to understand and gave suggestions as I
            was typing e.g different colour options. I enjoyed using this program for my project as it helped me clearly
            see what I was creating and with the way I had it all formatted I knew where to add information each time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also learnt about CSS and did this on Visual Studio Code and this was useful as I got to add different
            fonts,colours and a background image on my site which made it look more professional.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trello was appropriate for this project as I have mentioned it helped me plan out each task I created and
            completed. Colour coding each unit definitely helped me when keeping track of which tasks I needed to
            complete.
        </p>
        <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h2>
        <p>
            In this project I think my strengths are my colour scheme, the small different gif images and my font
            choices. I think that the colour scheme is good because it matches because most of my elements are blue. The
            different gif images were something that I wanted to add from the start to have a little difference on each
            page.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for weaknesses and improvements I believe I need more layout content such as maybe having sidebars or
            have the main text content laid out better e.g having every page have all the text in a box without having a
            break between paragraphs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Am I happy with the website? I am happy with how far the website has come from the start to where it has
            ended up. However I think there are improvements I could definitely make to make the website look better
            such as the few I mentioned under the weaknesses.
        </p>
        <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h2>
        <p>
            Looking back on the project I think to improve my website I would make each page have a different theme.
            Even though I like having the same theme throughout I had this improvement idea just so the user has
            something different to see on each page rather than the same blue striped background and colour scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would have also liked to include more CSS code to make visual improvements to my website such as text
            placement, navigation bar layout however as CSS is a completely new language to me I was not 100%
            comfortable with trying lots of different things especially as my website is working correctly as it is.
        </p>
        <h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
        <p>
            When creating my site there were different outcomes I wanted to achieve to make my website functional and
            professional such as preparing appropriate content for my site which I did by drawing up a plan of how I
            wanted the pages to look and what content would be on it. While creating it there were some minor
            differences but I think I fulfilled my original planned design very well.

        </p>
        <p>
            I also had to change some file formats for documents as it was necessary to display on my page because I
            went to download a .GIF but it firstly saved as a web page file so I had to re-download it and add .GIF at
            the end of the file name in order to change the file type and make sure it would show correctly on the page.

        </p>
        <p>
            Also all of my pages on my website were error free page which means that they all load correctly and there
            are no display issues such as links, text and images not appearing and as my site has the same theme on all
            of the pages it makes it a lot easier to make sure there are no errors as there are not differences and
            therefore more issues that could crop up and mess something up on a page.
