        <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed â€“ in making your own website, are you
            happy with the tools you used? </h2>
        <p>
            Visual Studio Code is what I used to create my website, without it my website would not exist. Throughout
            the process it was easy to use and any errors I occurred were done due to me missing some sort of
            punctuation like { or ;
        </p>
        <p>
            I kept updating my Trello board throughout the project to make me aware of what tasks I was needing to
            complete and the tasks I had finished. I colour coded the questions by what unit they were a part of and
            left the website tasks not colour coded.
        </p>
        <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>
        <p>
            Visual Studio Code was definitely an appropriate tool as it was easy to understand and gave suggestions as I
            was typing e.g different colour options. I enjoyed using this program for my project as it helped me clearly
            see what I was creating and with the way I had it all formatted I knew where to add information each time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also learnt about CSS and did this on Visual Studio Code and this was useful as I got to add different
            fonts,colours and a background image on my site which made it look more professional.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trello was appropriate for this project as I have mentioned it helped me plan out each task I created and
            completed. Colour coding each unit definitely helped me when keeping track of which tasks I needed to
            complete.
