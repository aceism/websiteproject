        <h2> 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of
            productivity and effciency </h2>
        <p>
            I feel like I could have been more efficient with CSS and researched some more features that I could have
            tried out. CSS to me was a completely new language which is why I did not feel as confident using it on my
            project that much, however I can see how useful it is for creating websites and making the layout more
            dynamic and flexible such as sizes of different parts of the site and making the website layout better on
            mobile devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also believe if I did this project in teams I could have worked on my strengths and other team members it
            would be more time efficient and get different parts of the website completed faster if these tasks were
            split between members and they could focus on theirs such as planning or HTML or CSS and it could make the
            website the best it can be.

        </p>
        <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and effciency </h2>
        <p>
            In order to improve productivity and efficiency within any area of working life it is important to plan out
            any task you are trying to do as if you are just looking at a project as a whole and not individual
            manageable tasks it will make the project seem very daunting and maybe even impossible to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            I feel like during this project I could have taken breaks throughout the day as I had not taken any in order
            to stay completely focused on the task. However if I did take breaks I could have come back to the project
            feeling refreshed and see the project differently than I would be after staring at it for hours working on
            it.
        </p>
        <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects </h2>
        <p>
            I feel like I would be interested in doing digital projects with a team as it would be good to be able to
            divide up tasks between people and can give deadlines for people to be able to focus on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another idea is to use Slack as it is a good communication tool and can allow you to talk to other people
            within your team and give on-going updates to any projects. It's easily accessible on any device such as
            laptops, computers and phones (on the app).
        </p>
        <p>
            I feel like these would both make me more productive because if I was in a team it would help me be more
            conscious of my time and give me a set specific task to focus on instead of overthinking a whole entire
            project.
        </p>
        <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h2>
        <p>
            When testing digital solutions it is important to make sure every single feature it looked at, for example
            on my website I had to check every single hyperlink worked correctly and went to the right page or external
            website.


        </p>
        <p>
            Having different people check a project and give feedback is also good as it allows a fresh pair of eyes to
            review the project and be honest with their thoughts on the appearance and functions and give you an
            opportunity to change things before publishing or presenting your project to more people.
        </p>
        <p>
            For my website I had the people around me look at my website and give me feedback on how the site looks and
            how it could be improved. This feedback helped me have a link hover on my navigation bar and made the font
            different compared to the headings and main body text.
