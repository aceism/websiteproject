        <h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>
        <p>
            With my website I put each Unit on a different page as shown with the navigation bar (Unit 1 Outcome 1, Unit
            1 Outcome 2, Unit 1 Outcome 3 Review and Unit 2 Outcome 1) and each page has answers to different questions.
            I also have the same layout on every page so that it is not jarring for the user to switch pages on the
            site, the only difference is the gif on each page, each one is a different Pokemon.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have a colour coded the site in a blue colour, the background is blue striped, the hover links in the
            navigation bar are blue and the text background is blue.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also used the same 3 fonts on each page for the headings, the navigation bar and the text this also is to
            make going through the website a lot more user friendly and I made sure the font was displayed in a bigger
            size (20px) so if anyone has trouble seeing the text it should not be an issue when viewing my site.
        </p>
        <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
        <p>
            Copyright is something that can affect websites, an example of this is when an image/video/music is used by
            the website owner even though it is not originally theirs e.g. not taken by them. This means if the original
            photo/video owner comes across their image/video/music being used on a site without their permission they
            could ask them to take it down and could even take legal action if they believe its the right thing to do. A
            way to avoid that situation is to use images/videos/music that are copyright free or use your own content
            therefore it is legally yours to use.</p>
        <p>
            Another constraint is sometimes layouts on websites can differ between devices e.g.
            computer and mobile. The website might not have been designed with a mobile layout in mind even though a
            majority of the population only use their phones to browse online. People should now really consider
            creating a seperate design specifically for phones e.g. iPhone and Android</p>
    </div>
    <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account</h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to websites there can be some issues when using them, this is to be expected but some could be
        changed and fixed.</p>
    <p>
        For example if people have difficulty with their vision you could make sure that the text is bigger on the pages
        more than the default 11 or 12 font size. There is also options to have the text spoken out loud, which would be
        useful for people who are blind and want to be able to know the content of your website, and if you write a
        description for your images they can be read out as well to describe the visual elements.
    </p>
    <h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>
    <p>
        There are filetypes that are used to make websites appear correctly on PC's/Devices. HMTL and CSS are used
        during the website creation and the pages need to be saved with these typings. PNG and JPEG are used for images,
        MP3 is used for audio and MP4 is used for videos.</p>
