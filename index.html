        <p>I'm Rebecca and I am a 21 year old who has a passion and interest in computers.</p>

        <p>Ever since I was young I wanted to know how websites worked and were created as I had seen websites and
            wanted to replicate what they had done. I also wanted to do anything related to computers in the future
            and
            did not even realise a career in IT was even possible until I reached high school. </p>

        <p>After I completed high
            school I made the decision in college to pursue my interest in computers and took BTEC Level 2 IT and
            then
            progressed to the Level 3 course a year after. In this course I achieved all distinction *'s overall.
            I've
            even spent 8 months in an IT Support Engineer role for an apprenticeship.</p>

        <p>Now onto today where I am on the Code Nation course. I decided to sign up for this course as it had a
            unit
            about website development, and here I am making the website that you are reading this on. I also like
            the
            fact it gave me a chance to learn Python a coding language I had heard of but did not know where to
            start
            with.</p>
        <p>So far I have really been enjoying the course as I have learnt so much in such a short space of time and
            hopefully I can take the skills I have learnt with me for any opportunities or job roles I have in the
            future.</p>
