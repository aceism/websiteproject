        <h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
        <p>
            An important factor in the business world now is having IT involved. This could come in many different forms
            such as having computers in an office for daily use, using computers to host the payment and stocking
            systems used in businesses such as newsagents and major supermarkets like Sainsburys and having the
            businesses servers set up and active to be accessed 24/7. </p>
        <p>
            IT is also a great way for helping businesses get their name out there by having a social media presence on
            sites such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook as almost everyone has one or even all of these accounts and
            information can easily be put out into the world and spread. Social media also can go hand in hand with a
            business having a website as it allows the business to have its own presence on the internet and really show
            themselves off in a format that suits them.</p>

        <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2>
        <p>
            When trying to complete a digital project successfully there are a number of different methods, skills and
            resources you can use to complete it to the best of your ability. A needed skill is having good time
            management skills in order to prioritise the tasks you have set yourself as otherwise you could get
            distracted and leave things needed until last minute.</p>

        <p>
            If working in a team you will need to communicate with everyone so all team members is aware of what is
            going
            on and making their contributions towards the project.</p>

        <p>
            As for resources almost everything online is a resource however specifically in the past I have used Trello
            and Draw.io. Trello is used as a planning website and Draw.io is used for making flowcharts. Trello is a
            good method of planning any tasks into specific columns you set up and can clearly show what is needed to
            complete a project. Draw.io is another useful tool that can help visualise the project e.g. creating a
            website and having a set plan for each page and how they are linked together.
        </p>
        <h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h2>
        <p>
            Having a plan for any sort of task is vital and detail is needed during this stage because you will have put
            down the ideas you have, the direction you want the project to go in and see how much progress has been made
            overall. Splitting tasks is also needed and can be decided during this stage so then you and any others
            working
            on the project know what they need to do.
        </p>

        <p>
            As mentioned previously there are 2 sites I have used in the past when planning out a project, and have used
            to
            help me create this site.</p>

        <p>
            Trello is also a useful site to use when organising the tasks as you could create different columns for 'To
            Do'
            'Doing' and 'Done' and this makes it clear to see what type of tasks need to be done and where everyone is
            up to.<a href="https://trello.com/b/334f7Onu/website"> Here is an example of the Trello board I created for
                this website.</a> </p>

        <p>
            Draw.io is used for creating flowcharts, it allows multiple people to have access and edit the page at once
            therefore the workflow can be more productive. It also has a lot of options when it comes to the shapes,
            colours
            and fonts used. Colour coding a flowchart can really help as once you have had a quick glance you can tell
            if a
            task is completed or not, or can be colour coded in how the pages are linked together.</p>

        <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h2>
        <p>
            When working on a digital project there is a possibility that something could go wrong and cause it to fail.
            Usually these are down to technical faults that occur such as the internet/Wi-Fi being down and therefore
            inaccessible, this would heavily hurt a project if it was all based online such as a businesses' website or
            any programs that require internet access such as VOIP (Voice over internet protocol) which is used on
            phones - this could be how someone working on a project communicates with a customer who is using their
            services e.g making a website. And for any websites used for the project could be inaccessible during this
            time such as Draw.io and Trello.</p>

        <p>
            Another issue with the project could be that something has gone wrong while going through the creation
            process such as someone not doing their part of the project if it is done in a group or a minor issues such
            as if a website is being created and there is one character missing from the code. </p>

        <h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>
        <p>
            As there are so many IT systems and software out in the world it could be difficult to try and figure out
            which specific ones you use for a project. You have to make sure that they meet all the requirements of what
            you are trying to achieve such as being able to let you code effectively.</p>

        <p>
            There is different programs that can used to code such as Visual Studio Code which is available for download
            for free on PC's that run the Windows operating system. There is however paid subscriptions which allow the
            user to have more features, 'Professional' which is $45 (£34.55) per month and 'Enterprise' is $250
            (£191.95) per month. <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/ ">[1]</a></p>

        <h2> 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcome</h2>
        <p>
            Trello has been extremely useful when planning out what tasks I would be doing. As mentioned in the planning
            section 1.3 there are columns you can create on this site to divide up the work you have to do. It helped me
            visualise what tasks I had to do, tasks that I was currently working on and then tasks I had completed.</p>

        <p>
            Github was used in order to post the coding I had online, this allows me to be able to access my code from
            any device even if the code is not saved there such as using a laptop from home instead of in an office.
        </p>

        <h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects </h2>
        <p>
            GDPR (which stands for General Data Protection Regulation) is a newer regulation which is in place for the
            public to be able to be to request any data they have and if requested it has to be removed from a
            businesses database.</p>

        <p>
            This means if your project has any information from people giving feedback or customers and they request for
            their information to be removed it can be. This could be an issue for a website with testimonials if the
            person who wrote it wants their data removed because this would be from the backend of the site and the
            frontend.</p>
